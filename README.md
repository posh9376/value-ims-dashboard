# Welcome

# 📦 IMS Admin Dashboard
Welcome to the Admin Dashboard for the Inventory Management System (IMS)!
This is where inventory chaos turns into organized glory ✨.

Built with Vite ⚡ + React ⚛️, this dashboard is fast, modern, and sleek — just like your soon-to-be well-managed inventory.



# 🚀 Features (a.k.a. Superpowers)
- 🧮 Inventory Overview – see all your products, quantities, and categories at a glance.
- 👤 User Management – add, edit, or remove users like a true overlord.
- 📊 Analytics – pretty charts because spreadsheets are boring.
- 🔔 Notifications – stay in the loop when stock levels are wild.
- 🎨 Modern UI – smooth, responsive, and dark mode-ready (because we care about your eyes).

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
- React + Vite – super fast frontend development.
- TailwindCSS / shadcn UI – because styling should be painless.
- Recharts – for those satisfying graphs 📈.
- React Router – smooth navigation, no teleportation glitches.
